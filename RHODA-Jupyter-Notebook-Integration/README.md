#### Red Hat Openshift Database Access (RHODA) Integration with Jupyter Notebook


### June 20, 2022 | by Michelle DiPalma & Veda Shankar

Integrating Jupyter notebooks with OpenShift cloud services allows data scientists to get started quickly, without having to understand or manage any of the OpenShift infrastructure details. This **[video](https://youtu.be/VRcSZBqw3zc)** demonstrates the service binding between a Jupyter notebook and the Red Hat OpenShift Database Access connection to database cloud services. This allows a notebook user to access database instances without ever leaving their notebook to obtain credentials.

For folks wanting to try it on their own, the Jupyter Notebooks referred to in the video are available in the **[rhoda-notebook-controller](https://github.com/RHODA-lab/rhoda-notebook-controller/tree/main/Notebooks)** Github repository. This video is meant as a follow on video to Red Hat OpenShift Database Access admin/developer workflows explained here:
